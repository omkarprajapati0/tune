What we chasin'?  Why the bottom? Why the basement?  Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?  Why the feel for the need to replace me?  You're the wrong way track from the good  I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at  Like a heart in the best way should  You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay  But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors  Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours  Keep also home  'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'  Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out, baby  I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out, darlin'  I'm fighting hard to hold my own  Just can't make it all alone  I'm holding on, I can't fall back  I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black  I'm beggin', beggin' you  Put your loving hand out, baby  I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out, darlin'  I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out, baby  I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out, darlin'  I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out, baby  I'm beggin', beggin' you  So put your loving hand out`
